# 🧠 CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN

This project showcases a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using **Keras** and **TensorFlow** to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 different classes. It demonstrates fundamental deep learning concepts such as data preprocessing, model architecture design, data augmentation, and evaluation using performance metrics.
